Here's a sample README for your Telegram Chatbot that uses an LLM for metadata generation:

# Telegram Chatbot with LLM for Metadata Generation

This is a Flask-based Telegram chatbot that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to interact with users and generate metadata from their input. The bot is designed to process user queries and generate structured metadata efficiently using Hugging Face's Mistral-7B-Instruct model.

## Features

- **Chat Interface**: The bot can converse with users in a Telegram chat.
- **Metadata Generation**: It generates metadata based on the user’s input using an LLM.
- **Lightweight Deployment**: Utilizes the Hugging Face Inference API for efficient model usage, reducing local memory overhead.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.7+
- Telegram Bot API Token (create a bot using [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather) on Telegram)
- Hugging Face API Token (get one by signing up on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/join))

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/telegram-llm-metadata-bot.git
    cd telegram-llm-metadata-bot
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    Ensure the `requirements.txt` file contains:
    ```
    Flask
    requests
    huggingface-hub
    ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables:**

    Replace the placeholders in the script with your actual API keys:
    - Telegram Bot API Token
    - Hugging Face API Token

    ```python
    bot_token = "YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN"
    huggingface_api_key = "YOUR_HUGGING_FACE_API_KEY"
    ```

## Running the Bot

1. **Start the Flask App:**

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

2. **Set Up the Webhook:**

    Use the Telegram Bot API to set your webhook to the server where you’re running the Flask app.

    ```bash
    curl -X POST "https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/setWebhook?url=<YOUR_SERVER_URL>/webhook"
    ```

    Replace `<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>` and `<YOUR_SERVER_URL>` with your actual bot token and server URL (e.g., a Render server or local tunnel like ngrok).

## How It Works

1. The bot listens for POST requests at the `/webhook` endpoint, triggered by messages sent to your Telegram bot.
2. Upon receiving a message, the bot uses the Hugging Face model to generate metadata from the user’s input.
3. The generated metadata is sent back as a response to the user in the Telegram chat.

### Example Flow:

- User: "Tell me about the Eiffel Tower."
- Bot: "Metadata generated: The Eiffel Tower is a famous landmark in Paris, France..."

## Deployment

You can deploy the app on platforms like [Render](https://render.com/) or [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

### Example Render Deployment Steps:

1. Commit your code to a GitHub repository.
2. Connect your Render account to the repository.
3. Create a new Web Service on Render, and deploy your app.

## Troubleshooting

- **Memory Issues**: Ensure you are using a lightweight API call rather than running models locally.
- **Webhook Issues**: Double-check that the webhook URL is correctly set, and your Flask app is running on the correct port.
